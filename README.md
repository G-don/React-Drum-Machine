##Description

As a music producer who started creating instrumentals with an MPC (Music Production Centre) aka drum machine, developing this React app that combines my passion for music and programming has been a truly immersive experience. 

You can play the drum machine using the keyboard by simply pressing the letters associated with each drum pad, and you can click the button to change the soundbank and use two soundbanks of nine samples each to start making some beats. 

##Instructions

To get started with the Drum Machine, follow these simple steps

1 - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2 - Install the necessary dependencies using npm install.

3 - Run the application locally using npm start.

4 - Explore the Drum Machine interface and interact with the drum pads to create your beats.

5 - Adjust the volume slider to control the overall sound level.

6 - Switch between the two soundbanks by clicking the appropriate button.

7 - Experiment and find your own unique rhythm!


##Features

On/off function for easy control of the drum machine.
 
Two soundbanks with nine different samples each, switchable with a single click.
 
Volume control for precise audio output.

Play the drum pads with the keyboard to suit different playing styles.

##Visuals

To help you better understand the flow and functionality of the Drum Machine, I have included a package of screenshots. These visuals will give you an insight into the application's interface and guide you through its features.

##ROADMAP

I'm committed to improve this Drum Machine and bringing it closer to the experience of a real MPC (Music Production Centre). Here are some of the features I plan to add in the future:

Rec Button: Record your instrumentals right in the app.

Click button: Add a clap or snare sound to mark the rhythm and add layers to your beats.

BPM slider: Adjust the beats per minute (BPM) to increase or decrease the tempo.

Pitch effect: Apply a pitch effect to manipulate the pitch of individual drum sounds.
